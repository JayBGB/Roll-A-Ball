# Roll-A-Ball
## A Unity Demo Game

Welcome to Roll-A-Ball, a small but captivating Unity project where players embark on an adventure _(if you can call rolling around a small scenario an "adventure")_ to collect twelve shimmering coins scattered throughout the captivating landscape _(which, of course, means a square shaped box with low walls)_.

### Features:
- **Captivating Gameplay**: Immerse yourself in an engaging gameplay experience where your objective is to collect all twelve coins strewn across the scenic environment. _(I am getting Peter Molyneux vibes with all these lies...)_
- **Dynamic Sound Effects**: Each coin collection is accompanied by a delightful sound effect, adding an extra layer of immersion and satisfaction to your gaming experience.
- **Immersive Audio**: Enjoy an immersive audio experience with background music that sets the mood for your journey and victory tunes that celebrate your triumphs. _(Huh, wasn't that a bit Todd Howard-y?)_
- **Responsive Controls**: Seamlessly navigate through the terrain with responsive controls that allow you to move and jump effortlessly.
- **Mind the Gap**: Be cautious not to overshoot your jumps and fall off the map! Precision and timing are crucial to your success.
